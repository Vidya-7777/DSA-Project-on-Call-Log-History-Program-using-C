# Call Log History Program in C

## Overview
This project implements a Call Log History system using C programming. It uses a doubly linked list data structure to efficiently store and manage the history of dialed phone numbers and contacts. The system allows users to dial new numbers, call from contacts, view the most recent call, and display the full call history.
